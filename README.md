## About Me

My name is Megan. I'm an English language teacher who found herself out of a job and working admin jobs to make ends meet. But, it was through my job that I was able to go back to school (again) to work on becoming a DBA with a focus in User Experience. I have really enjoyed designing databases and setting them up in PGAdmin, MySQL and SQL Server. Along with that, I (fortunately) love learning and puzzles, and so I've enjoyed learning how to set up server stacks and creating small web apps with Django (Python). 

In my free time I like to run, play video games (currently obsessed with Overwatch, Valheim, and Minecraft), build gundams, and learning powershell and other automation scripting. I have two cats, but love all animals in general (grew up in a more rural area and was always around horses, ducks, cows, etc.). I lived in Taiwan for a year and have studied a bit of Mandarin; though unfortunately my speaking ability it awful and my listening comprehension is getting worse the longer I'm away. My partner and I have been starting to learn Japanese during the pandemic, and while they are infinitely better at the grammar, I have enjoyed the advantage when it comes to Kanji. :D

Something I am most proud of is that I built my first PC as my pandemic product. I flooded it with LEDs (as obnoxious as people find it) because I always wanted a super loud PC. It's currently set to a gradiant between Red, Pink, and Blue and I love it.

I'm an introvert, but love one on one connections with people. So, if any of the above sounds interesting to you or you ever want to chat, feel free to reach out. :)
